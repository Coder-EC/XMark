/**
 * This frame class is the base class of the frame app system. provides
 * the basic looking, allows the content panel to display. This frame
 * contains a self-made title bar, which has a "XMark" title on it, and
 * the path of current file in the editor. On the right side of the title
 * bar, omit three buttons of frame resizing: close, max and min. You
 * don't need to pass any arguments to the constructor, because it will
 * automatically fill in the title and the icon. The title bar will be
 * placed in the content pane because the frame is undecorated, meaning
 * there will be no extra border and title bar.
 * This class extends JFrame and uses its methods.
